# ðŸš€ Phase 1 Quick Start Guide

## ðŸ“Š **Data Analysis & Pattern Recognition**

Now that you have **7,100+ data points** collected, it's time to analyze them and find trading opportunities!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 1 Goals**

1. âœ… Understand what your data is telling you
2. âœ… Calculate technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, etc.)
3. âœ… Identify patterns and trends
4. âœ… Build analysis tools and dashboards

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: Your data collection system (already running!)

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Week 1: Basic Analysis**

### **Day 1-2: Explore Your Data**

Run the analysis script to see what you've collected:

```bash
# Analyze your collected data
python scripts/analyze_data.py
```

This will show you:
- Total ticks collected
- Price ranges for SPY/QQQ
- Recent price movements
- Basic statistics

### **Day 3-4: Add Technical Indicators**

Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy ta-lib matplotlib plotly
```

Common indicators to implement:
- **Moving Averages**: SMA(10), SMA(30), EMA(12), EMA(26)
- **RSI**: Relative Strength Index (14-period)
- **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence
- **Bollinger Bands**: Price volatility bands
- **Volume Analysis**: Track unusual volume

### **Day 5-7: Pattern Recognition**

Look for these patterns in your data:
- **Trend Detection**: Is price moving up, down, or sideways?
- **Support/Resistance**: Where does price bounce?
- **Breakouts**: When does price break through levels?
- **Reversals**: When does trend change direction?

---

## ðŸ”§ **Tools You'll Build**

### **1. Data Analysis Script** (Already Created!)
```bash
python scripts/analyze_data.py
```

Shows:
- Overall statistics
- Price movements
- Basic indicators
- Daily summaries

### **2. Technical Indicator Calculator**
Calculate indicators in real-time:
- Moving averages
- RSI
- MACD
- Bollinger Bands

### **3. Pattern Detector**
Automatically identify:
- Bullish/bearish trends
- Support/resistance levels
- Breakout opportunities
- Reversal signals

### **4. Visualization Dashboard**
Create charts showing:
- Price movements over time
- Technical indicators overlaid
- Volume patterns
- Buy/sell signals

## ðŸ“Š **Example Analysis Queries**

### **Check Data Quality**
```sql
-- How much data do you have?
SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) as ticks
FROM index_tick_data
GROUP BY symbol;

-- Data collection rate
SELECT 
    symbol,
    COUNT(*) / EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp))) as ticks_per_second
FROM index_tick_data
GROUP BY symbol;
```

### **Price Analysis**
```sql
-- Today's price range
SELECT 
    symbol,
    MIN(price) as low,
    MAX(price) as high,
    MAX(price) - MIN(price) as range
FROM index_tick_data
WHERE DATE(timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY symbol;

-- Hourly price movement
SELECT 
    symbol,
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', timestamp) as hour,
    AVG(price) as avg_price,
    STDDEV(price) as volatility
FROM index_tick_data
GROUP BY symbol, hour
ORDER BY hour DESC;
```

### **Volume Analysis**
```sql
-- Average volume by hour
SELECT 
    symbol,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM timestamp) as hour,
    AVG(volume) as avg_volume
FROM index_tick_data
GROUP BY symbol, hour
ORDER BY symbol, hour;
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ **What to Look For**

### **Bullish Signals**
- Price above moving averages
- RSI between 40-70 (not overbought)
- MACD positive and rising
- Volume increasing on up moves

### **Bearish Signals**
- Price below moving averages
- RSI above 70 (overbought)
- MACD negative and falling
- Volume increasing on down moves

### **Neutral/Ranging**
- Price oscillating around moving averages
- RSI between 30-70
- MACD near zero
- Low volatility

## ðŸš€ **Quick Wins**

### **This Week:**

1. **Run Analysis Script**
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_data.py
   ```
   
2. **Calculate Simple Moving Average**
   ```python
   # Get last 30 data points
   # Calculate average
   # Compare to current price
   ```

3. **Identify Trend**
   ```python
   # Is price above or below SMA?
   # Is price rising or falling?
   # How strong is the trend?
   ```

4. **Create Simple Chart**
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   # Plot price over time
   # Add moving average line
   # Show on screen
   ```

## ðŸ’» **Code Examples**

### **Calculate Moving Average**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Connect to database
engine = create_engine('postgresql://...')

# Get recent data
query = """
SELECT price, timestamp 
FROM index_tick_data 
WHERE symbol = 'SPY'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 100
"""

df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# Calculate SMA
df['sma_10'] = df['price'].rolling(window=10).mean()
df['sma_30'] = df['price'].rolling(window=30).mean()

# Check trend
current_price = df['price'].iloc[0]
sma_10 = df['sma_10'].iloc[0]
sma_30 = df['sma_30'].iloc[0]

if current_price > sma_10 > sma_30:
    print("ðŸŸ¢ STRONG BULLISH TREND")
elif current_price > sma_10:
    print("ðŸŸ¢ BULLISH")
elif current_price < sma_10 < sma_30:
    print("ðŸ”´ STRONG BEARISH TREND")
else:
    print("ðŸ”´ BEARISH")
```

### **Calculate RSI**
```python
def calculate_rsi(prices, period=14):
    """Calculate Relative Strength Index"""
    deltas = prices.diff()
    gain = deltas.where(deltas > 0, 0)
    loss = -deltas.where(deltas < 0, 0)
    
    avg_gain = gain.rolling(window=period).mean()
    avg_loss = loss.rolling(window=period).mean()
    
    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    
    return rsi

# Use it
df['rsi'] = calculate_rsi(df['price'])

# Check for signals
current_rsi = df['rsi'].iloc[0]

if current_rsi < 30:
    print("ðŸŸ¢ OVERSOLD - Potential BUY signal")
elif current_rsi > 70:
    print("ðŸ”´ OVERBOUGHT - Potential SELL signal")
else:
    print("âšª NEUTRAL")
```
