## üí° Ways to Save Money

### **1. Stop During Weekends** (Save ~30%)
Market is closed weekends, so stop the droplet:

```bash
# Friday evening
doctl compute droplet-action power-off <droplet-id>

# Monday morning
doctl compute droplet-action power-on <droplet-id>
```

**Savings**: ~$1.80/month ($21.60/year)

### **2. Use Hourly Billing**
DigitalOcean charges by the hour ($0.009/hour):
- Only pay when droplet is running
- Can destroy and recreate as needed
- Good if testing/not using full-time

### **3. Use Snapshots for Long Breaks**
If taking a break from trading:

```bash
# Take snapshot ($0.05/GB/month)
doctl compute droplet-action snapshot <droplet-id>

# Destroy droplet
doctl compute droplet delete <droplet-id>

# Recreate later from snapshot
doctl compute droplet create --image <snapshot-id>
```

**Savings**: Pay $1.25/month for snapshot vs $6/month for droplet

### **4. Share with Another Project**
Use the same droplet for multiple projects:
- Trading agent
- Personal website
- Other scripts

**Cost per project**: $3/month if sharing between 2 projects

### **5. Optimize Resource Usage**
Start with $6/month, only upgrade if needed:
- Monitor CPU/RAM usage
- Optimize collection frequency if high usage
- Don't upgrade unless necessary
