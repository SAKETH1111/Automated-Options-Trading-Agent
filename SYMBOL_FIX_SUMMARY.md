# 🔧 Symbol Fix - Removed Leveraged ETFs

## ❌ **Removed Symbols (Non-Standard Options):**

These leveraged ETFs don't work with Polygon options data:
- ❌ **SQQQ** - 3x inverse QQQ (options contract mismatch)
- ❌ **UVXY** - 2x VIX volatility (non-standard)
- ❌ **TZA** - 3x inverse small cap (non-standard)

**Why they don't work:**
- Leveraged ETFs often have non-standard option contracts
- Polygon's Options Starter plan may not cover these
- Contract symbols don't match standard format

## ✅ **Final Symbol List (9 Symbols):**

### **Batch 1: Primary Symbols (5)**
1. **SPY** - $550 (S&P 500) - ✅ Excellent options
2. **QQQ** - $480 (Nasdaq-100) - ✅ Excellent options

## 💡 **Alternative for $1K Accounts:**

If you really need sub-$30 symbols, consider:
- **F** (Ford) - ~$12
- **GOLD** (Barrick Gold) - ~$22
- **BAC** (Bank of America) - ~$35
- **T** (AT&T) - ~$16

These have **standard options** that work with all brokers and data providers!

## 🚀 **Training Status:**

Looking at your logs, I see:
- ✅ **Data collection working!** (84,091 samples collected)
- ✅ **SQQQ stock data collected** (20,064 bars)
- ⚠️ **SQQQ options failing** (contract mismatch)
- ⚠️ **Still delta comparison error** (unsupported operand)

The training is continuing despite SQQQ options errors (using default features), but we should remove it for cleaner training.

## 🔧 **Next Steps:**

1. Deploy updated batches (without leveraged ETFs)
2. Train Batch 1: SPY, QQQ, IWM, DIA, XLF
3. Train Batch 2: GDX, TLT, XLE, EWZ
4. All symbols have working options!
