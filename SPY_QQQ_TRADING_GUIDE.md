## 🎯 Your Optimized Strategies

### Strategy 1: SPY/QQQ Bull Put Spread (PRIMARY)

**Setup:**
- DTE: 30-45 days
- Short Put Delta: -0.20 to -0.25 (80-75% probability of profit)
- Width: $5-$15
- Target Credit: $0.40+

**Example Trade:**
```
SPY @ $450
Sell $440 Put (30 DTE, -0.23Δ) @ $3.00
Buy $435 Put (30 DTE) @ $2.40
Net Credit: $0.60 ($60 per contract)
Max Loss: $440 (if SPY < $435)
Win if SPY stays above $440 (77% probability)
```

**Why This Works:**
- SPY/QQQ have strong upward bias historically
- 77%+ win rate when properly managed
- Take profit at 50% ($30 in example)
- Stop loss at 100% loss ($60 loss = close)

### Strategy 2: SPY Iron Condor (NEUTRAL)

**Setup:**
- DTE: 30-45 days
- Put Delta: -0.15 to -0.18 (85% OTM)
- Call Delta: 0.15 to 0.18 (85% OTM)
- Width: $10
- Target Credit: $0.60+

**When to Use:**
- VIX 15-25 (moderate volatility)
- Market is range-bound
- Expecting sideways movement
- IV Rank > 30

**Example:**
```
SPY @ $450
Sell $435/$425 Put Spread: +$0.50
Sell $465/$475 Call Spread: +$0.50
Total Credit: $1.00 ($100 per IC)
Max Loss: $9.00 ($900) if SPY moves >$25
Win if SPY stays $425-$465 (very wide range!)
```

### Strategy 3: 0DTE Strategy (ADVANCED - Start After 3 Months)

**Setup:**
- Same-day expiration
- Entry: 10:00 AM ET (after opening volatility)
- Exit: 3:45 PM ET (before close)
- Very OTM: -0.05 to -0.10 delta
- Small size: 1-2 contracts max
- Quick profits: 30% take profit

**Why Wait:**
