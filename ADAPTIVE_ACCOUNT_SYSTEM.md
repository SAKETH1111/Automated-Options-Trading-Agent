# ðŸŽ¯ Adaptive Account System - Complete Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ **What I Built for You:**

A **smart system** that automatically adjusts ALL trading parameters based on your account size!

---

## ðŸ§  **How It Works:**

### **The System Automatically:**

1. âœ… **Detects your account size** every day
2. âœ… **Assigns you to a tier** (Micro/Small/Medium/Standard/Large)
3. âœ… **Adjusts risk %** based on tier + market conditions
4. âœ… **Selects optimal symbols** for your account size
5. âœ… **Chooses DTE** (weekly vs monthly) based on IV and confidence
6. âœ… **Upgrades your tier** automatically as account grows!

---

## ðŸ’° **Account Tiers (Automatic):**

| Tier | Balance Range | Risk % | Max Positions | Symbols | Spreads | DTE |
|------|---------------|--------|---------------|---------|---------|-----|
| **Micro** | $1K-$2.5K | 12% | 1 | SQQQ, GDX, UVXY | $1-$2 | 7-14d |
| **Small** | $2.5K-$5K | 8% | 2 | GDX, XLF, TLT | $2-$5 | 14-30d |
| **Medium** | $5K-$10K | 5% | 3 | XLF, IWM, SPY | $3-$5 | 21-45d |
| **Standard** | $10K-$25K | 3% | 4 | SPY, QQQ, IWM | $5-$10 | 30-45d |
| **Large** | $25K+ | 2% | 6 | SPY, QQQ, IWM, DIA, XLF, XLE | $5-$15 | 30-60d |

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Intelligent DTE Selection:**

The system chooses **weekly vs monthly** based on:

### **Uses WEEKLY (7-14 DTE) when:**
- âœ… Account < $2,500 (need fast income)
- âœ… IV Rank > 50 (high premium available)
- âœ… ML Confidence > 80% (very confident)
- âœ… Volatility forecast = "increasing" (close before spike)
- âœ… Win streak > 2 trades (momentum trading)

### **Uses MONTHLY (30-45 DTE) when:**
- âœ… Account > $10,000 (can be patient)
- âœ… IV Rank < 40 (need more time for theta)
- âœ… ML Confidence < 65% (less confident = more time)
- âœ… Volatility forecast = "stable" (can hold longer)
- âœ… Loss streak > 1 trade (slow down)

### **Uses BI-WEEKLY (14-30 DTE) when:**
- âœ… Account $2,500-$10,000 (balanced approach)
- âœ… IV Rank 30-50 (moderate premium)
- âœ… ML Confidence 65-75% (moderate confidence)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Intelligent Risk Selection:**

The system chooses **Conservative vs Aggressive** based on:

### **More AGGRESSIVE (higher %) when:**
- âœ… Account < $5,000 (need growth)
- âœ… IV Rank > 50 (good premium)
- âœ… ML Confidence > 75% (confident)
- âœ… Win rate > 70% (recent success)
- âœ… Low drawdown < 5%

### **More CONSERVATIVE (lower %) when:**
- âœ… Account > $10,000 (preserve capital)
- âœ… IV Rank < 30 (low premium)
- âœ… ML Confidence < 65% (uncertain)
- âœ… Win rate < 60% (struggling)
- âœ… Drawdown > 10%

## ðŸ“Š **Real Examples:**

### **Example 1: $1,500 Micro Account**

**Scenario:** New trader, high IV (VIX=22), ML confidence 72%

```
Auto-Detected Tier: Micro
Risk: 12% Ã— 1.2 (high IV) Ã— 1.1 (decent confidence) = 15.8%
Risk Dollars: $237
Symbols: SQQQ, GDX, UVXY
DTE: 7-14 days (weekly)
Reason: "Small account + high IV = weekly aggressive"

Trade Example:
- SQQQ $8.50/$7.50 Bull Put Spread
- Risk: $90 per contract
- Can trade: 2 contracts ($180 risk)
- Credit: $0.40 ($40 per contract Ã— 2 = $80 income)
- Win if SQQQ stays above $8.50 for 1 week
```

### **Example 2: $4,000 Small Account**

**Scenario:** Some experience, moderate IV (VIX=18), ML confidence 68%

```
Auto-Detected Tier: Small
Risk: 8% Ã— 1.0 (medium IV) Ã— 1.0 (medium confidence) = 8%
Risk Dollars: $320
Symbols: XLF, TLT, GDX
DTE: 14-30 days (bi-weekly to monthly)
Reason: "Growing account, balanced approach"

Trade Example:
- XLF $40/$38 Bull Put Spread  
- Risk: $180 per contract
- Can trade: 1 contract
- Credit: $0.55 ($55 income)
- Win if XLF stays above $40 for 2-3 weeks
```

### **Example 3: $12,000 Standard Account**

**Scenario:** Experienced, low IV (VIX=14), ML confidence 82%

```
Auto-Detected Tier: Standard
Risk: 3% Ã— 0.7 (low IV) Ã— 1.3 (high confidence) = 2.7%
Risk Dollars: $324
Symbols: SPY, QQQ, IWM
DTE: 30-45 days (monthly, but willing to do shorter due to high confidence)
Reason: "Standard account, high confidence = flexible"

Trade Example:
- SPY $545/$540 Bull Put Spread
- Risk: $450 per contract
- Can trade: 0 contracts (not enough risk budget)
â†’ System suggests: SPY $543/$540 (narrow spread)
- Risk: $270 per contract
- Can trade: 1 contract
- Credit: $0.70 ($70 income)
```
