## Common Adjustments

### Rolling

**When to Roll**:
- Position threatened (price near short strike)
- 7-10 DTE remaining
- IV still elevated
- Can collect additional credit

**How to Roll**:
1. Close current position
2. Open new position at same strikes, later expiration
3. Collect net credit
4. Extend time for position to work

**Example**:
```
Current: SPY 440/435 put spread, 7 DTE, SPY @ $442
Roll to: SPY 440/435 put spread, 35 DTE
Collect additional $0.50 credit
```

### Legging Out

**When**:
- One side of spread threatened
- Want to reduce risk
- Lock in partial profits

**Example**:
```
Iron Condor threatened on put side
Close put spread: -$150 loss
Keep call spread: +$100 profit
Net: -$50 vs potential -$300 max loss
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Scaling In

Start with smaller position, add if profitable:
```
Week 1: 1 contract @ $1.00 credit
Week 2: 1 contract @ $1.00 credit
Week 3: 2 contracts @ $1.00 credit
Total: 4 contracts, $400 credit
```

### 2. Staggered Expirations

Multiple positions at different DTEs:
```
Position 1: 30 DTE
Position 2: 45 DTE
Position 3: 60 DTE
Benefits: Smooth P&L, consistent activity
```

### 3. Delta-Neutral Portfolio

Balance directional risk:
```
Bull Put Spread: -0.10 delta
Iron Condor: 0.00 delta
Total portfolio delta: -0.10 (nearly neutral)
```

## Strategy Performance Metrics

Track these metrics for each strategy:

### Required Metrics
- **Win Rate**: % of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Total wins / Total losses
- **Average Win**: Mean profit on winning trades
- **Average Loss**: Mean loss on losing trades
- **Max Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline

### Advanced Metrics
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
- **Sortino Ratio**: Downside risk-adjusted returns
- **Expectancy**: (Win% Ã— Avg Win) - (Loss% Ã— Avg Loss)
- **Recovery Factor**: Net Profit / Max Drawdown

### Target Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Excellent |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Win Rate | > 60% | > 70% |
| Profit Factor | > 1.5 | > 2.0 |
| Sharpe Ratio | > 1.0 | > 1.5 |

## Backtesting Strategies

Before enabling a strategy live:

1. **Historical Analysis**
   - Test on 1+ year of data
   - Include different market conditions
   - Account for commissions/slippage

2. **Walk-Forward Testing**
   - Optimize on training data
   - Test on out-of-sample data
   - Verify parameters are robust

3. **Paper Trading**
   - Run for 3+ months
   - Track all trades
   - Verify system works as expected

## Strategy Optimization

### Parameter Tuning

Test ranges:
```python
# Bull Put Spread optimization
dte_range: [20-50]
delta_range: [-0.35 to -0.15]
width_range: [5-15]
min_credit: [0.20-0.50]
```

### Learning from Trades

Analyze:
- Winning vs losing characteristics
- Entry timing (IV rank correlation)
- Exit timing (DTE at close)
- Greeks exposure at entry
- Market conditions

### Continuous Improvement

Monthly review:
1. Calculate performance metrics
2. Identify common errors
3. Adjust parameters
4. A/B test changes
5. Document results

## Troubleshooting

### Low Signal Generation

**Problem**: Not finding trades

**Solutions**:
- Expand watchlist
- Adjust delta ranges
- Lower IV rank minimum
- Check liquidity filters

### High Slippage
