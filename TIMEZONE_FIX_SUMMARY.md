# Timezone Fix - Central Time (Texas) Implementation

## Issue
- System was configured for Eastern Time (America/New_York)
- User is in Texas (Central Time Zone)
- Database timestamps were showing incorrect times (5-6 hours off)
- Market hours detection was incorrect

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files Updated
- ✅ `config/config.yaml` - Changed to America/Chicago
- ✅ `config/spy_qqq_config.yaml` - Changed to America/Chicago
- ✅ `config/adaptive_account_config.yaml` - Changed to America/Chicago
- ✅ `config/pdt_compliant_config.yaml` - Changed to America/Chicago

### 2. Source Code Files Updated
- ✅ `src/orchestrator.py` - Updated timezone and market hours
- ✅ `src/market_data/realtime_collector.py` - Fixed all timestamp storage
- ✅ `src/market_data/robust_collector.py` - Updated timezone
- ✅ `src/automation/signal_generator.py` - Updated market hours checks

### 3. Market Hours (Central Time)
**Trading Hours:**
- **Market Open:** 8:30 AM CT (9:30 AM ET)
- **Market Close:** 3:00 PM CT (4:00 PM ET)

**Scheduled Tasks:**
- Trading cycle: Every 5 minutes, 8:30 AM - 3:00 PM CT
- Position monitoring: Every 1 minute, 8:30 AM - 3:00 PM CT
- Daily analysis: 4:00 PM CT (after market close)
- Weekly learning: 7:00 PM CT on Sundays

**Safe Trading Window:**
- Avoid first 15 minutes: 8:30 - 8:45 AM CT
- Avoid last 15 minutes: After 2:45 PM CT

### 4. Extended Hours (Central Time)
- **Pre-market:** 3:00 AM - 8:30 AM CT
- **After-hours:** 3:00 PM - 7:00 PM CT
- **Closed:** 7:00 PM - 3:00 AM CT

## Database Timestamps
All new timestamps will now be stored in Central Time (America/Chicago) with timezone awareness.

**Previous tick data** (stored in UTC) will remain as-is. The system will correctly handle both.

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify market hours detection (should be open at 2:05 PM CT on trading days)
- [ ] Check new tick data timestamps (should show Central Time)
- [ ] Verify scheduled tasks run at correct Central Time
- [ ] Confirm trading window restrictions (8:45 AM - 2:45 PM CT)

## Current Status
✅ All configuration updated to Central Time (Texas)
✅ All source code updated
✅ Ready to deploy and test

## Notes
- Market still operates on Eastern Time (NYSE hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- System now correctly converts and displays in Central Time
- User in Texas will see local time zone in all logs and timestamps
