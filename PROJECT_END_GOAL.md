# 🚀 End Goal: Automated Options Trading Agent

## 🎯 Vision
To build an intelligent, self-sustaining **options trading agent** that autonomously analyzes market data, identifies high-probability opportunities, and executes trades—while managing risk, learning from prior mistakes, and maximizing long-term returns.
The system starts on **paper trading**, then transitions to **live** once profitability and stability are proven.

## 🧠 Core Outcome
A modular trading platform that:
- **Collects & analyzes** live/historical stock + options data.
- **Generates signals** with structured strategies (Bull Put Spreads, CSPs, Iron Condors).
- **Executes & manages** trades via Alpaca automatically.
- **Monitors risk & performance** with real-time metrics and alerts.
- **Learns & adapts** through post-trade analysis and reasoned parameter updates.

## ⚙️ Operational Capabilities
1. **Scan markets** for liquid, high-odds setups (DTE, delta, IV rank, OI, spread width).
2. **Enter/exit automatically** with take-profit, stop-loss, and roll rules.
3. **Control portfolio risk** (position sizing, per-day loss caps, per-symbol limits).
4. **Keep full audit logs** (decisions, orders, fills, greeks, IV, slippage, P&L).
5. **Run autonomously** within market hours, with safe restart and kill-switch.

## 🔁 Learning & Reasoning Loop (make losses useful)
- **Structured trade journal**: store inputs, decisions, execution, outcomes, and **reason tags**.
- **Error taxonomy**: entry-quality, liquidity/execution, volatility, risk policy, timing.
- **Attribution & diagnostics**: factor contribution and **explainable** reasons (e.g., SHAP).
- **Counterfactual checks**: test small parameter alternatives to estimate better outcomes.
- **Automated adjustments** (guard-railed): small, single-parameter nudges with A/B trials.
- **Learning cadence**: daily micro-updates; weekly report; monthly checkpoint.

### Minimal data schema
```json
{
  "trade_id": "UUID",
  "timestamp_enter": "...",
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "strategy": "bull_put_spread",
  "params": {"dte": 30, "short_delta": -0.25, "width": 5, "ivr_min": 25},
  "market_snapshot": {"price": 190.2, "ivr": 42, "oi_short": 1200, "spread": 0.08},
  "execution": {"limit_credit": 0.95, "fill_credit": 0.90, "slippage": 0.05},
  "risk": {"size": 1, "risk_pct": 0.8},
  "outcome": {"pnl": -45.00, "days_held": 5, "exit_reason": "stop_loss"},
  "reason_tags": ["liquidity/slippage", "ivr_drop"],
  "notes": "filled late; spread widened"
}
```

## 💰 Success Criteria
- ≥ 3 months paper trading with positive expectancy; replicate live.
- ≤ 1–2% loss per trade; ≤ 5% daily drawdown cap.
- **Learning impact**: 30–50% fewer repeat error tags, better calibration, improved Sharpe/Sortino.
- Low maintenance; weekly/monthly human review.
- Extensible framework for new strategies and data sources.

## 🧩 End Vision
A **personal quant system** that converts every trade—especially losses—into structured insight, steadily improving entries, sizing, and exits for durable, data-driven returns.
